# Onion Limited's Oniontree

Welcome to the Onion Limited's Oniontree repository. This repository stores addresses of Tor hidden services (onion services) in human and machine readable format (YAML).

## Motivation

The Internet already has many great resources where to discover onion services. The reality is that most of them are outdated and difficult to process for non-humans. We want to solve this by making the data processable for humans and computers alike, by organizing the data in a simple directory tree composed of YAML files.

To ensure regular updates of the database, it is important not to leave this responsibility to a single person. Instead a community of volunteers should be responsible for regular updates of the database, or perhaps, in the future, a self-reliant program.

## Contributions

You are free to contribute to this repository. You can modify the database either with your favorite text editor or use our ever-evolving [tools](https://github.com/onionltd/oniontree-tools).
